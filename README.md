# Where is ESX?

## UPDATE

here's some quick facts:
- i have rights to copy code (and much more) from  https://github.com/kanersps/essentialmode/tree/0b7285e494fb6943c0a39e2eed3d2bd02992523a as i am a copyright holder. with this information alone you can drop the dmca completly.
- we dont know why kanersps would do such a low thing. if you look what he's saying to people they are all celebrating yet for some reasons they say we're assholes. the same people celebrating are the people who started this attitude way back yet according to themselves i started it. doing dmcas is crossing a line, why do you even share any code in a modding community if you gonna behave like a complete dick.
- kanersps keeps saying that he cares about esx. but if he did he would've never done this dmca, especally since the original dmca wanted a) the entire repositorry deleted b) credit for "his work" he didn't even link. furthermore kanersps is lying in conversations with him (check esx discord for proof) on how he attempted to contact me in order to resolve the issue before claiming dmca. when we asked him for proof he kept changing subject and there's nothing in pms with him that confirms this. basicly kanersps is lying about that
- dmca will keep it down esx for permanate, unless you counter dmca. we have counter dmca which means unless kanersps takes this to court within 2 weeks esx will be back
- kanersps is lying in his dmca saying how he owns parts of code that are 100% original. the similarities are because we had to implement code that had the exact same featues. how you gonna go standalone if the code you're trying to ditch is needed, a perfect example is command handling.
- the only file you'd think kanersps "owns" in any way is the player.lua file. but understand that he shared a file **concept** on how "class" file should've been looking like. he cant claim dmca on that. even if he is then im a copyright holder from the code linked above so we don't give a fuck anyways. go look in his dmca request he is marking code that i fucking developed as his just because they do the same, and you might think its suspicious but fucking understand we must implement code that does the exact same.
- kanersps is lying to github about his project being licensed under AGPLv3. in the code above there's no license meaning it's licensed under "nolicense" - google it

you think our attitude is bad? go look in the fivem discord and kanersps discord they are all celebrating about this invalid dmca. just wait after 2 weeks we'll see if there's no consequenses to what happend

## original text

2020-04-22 we recieved an email from GitHub stating that kanersps had started a DMCA takedown notice against es_extended. https://pastebin.com/kKxwH7MS

In his initial notice he is saying that multiple files in ESX belong to him and he would like to be credited for everything he has done. He doesn't link the exact files that he claim he owns, just a link to our repo. This means that he wants the entire repo removed if we don't credit him for his code.

He is butthurt over how when we ditched essentialmode we created functions and other things that did what essentialmode did... But how do you expect us to ditch essentialmode if we cannot create our own command handling code? We can't. He claims in his second DMCA takedown notice https://pastebin.com/2q5cVHYS that our code is "stolen" from his project.
As I just said it's impossible to go standalone if we don't create the features essentialmode had to offer, command handling is a perfect example, and as you can imaine the code differences aren't huge.

He also mentions how his code is licensed under AGPLv3, and that ESX must also be licensed under the same. But this is false, ESX was developed around 2017 initially, (old time when it used essentialmode). What license was essentialmode on at that time you wonder? Good question, web archive has archived his old website, where it's clearly a nolicense license. http://web.archive.org/web/20180516175223/https://docs.essentialmode.com/#license

Gizz told me not to make an announcement, sorry mate. He has also said that we are in a modding community where the fivem devs are REVERSING a whole copyrighted game for us, meanwhile kanersps is spending time on a DMCA takedown to ruin the community.

Kanersps obviously have a weird intention we can't identify. Is it to destabilise ESX to tell everyone to move to extendedmode? And if so does the contributors of that project have anything to do with this? Is it to revenge on his shitty framework being ditched? Is it just to be a asshole? Maybe even the fivem developers are a part of it?

We don't know, and don't really know how GitHub are handling this DMCA takedown notice. I mean how can they take a takedown notice that don't even specify what files are infringing seriously? Some files in the ESX project, such as the server sided player class file might need a rewrite, in the meantime if required then we will remove that file and create our own from scratch.

TLDR esx got taken down by kanersps (invalidly, we are going to get justice) because he is sad we ditched him
